# Installing Bootstrap

Let's use the Bootstrap CSS framework to have some nice CSS styles out-of-the-box without us having to write all these CSS styles.

1. In your terminal, run the following command:
```
npm install --save bootstrap@4.0.0-alpha.6
```
This will install it locally in this project. The `--save` flag will save this package to your dependencies.

2. To be able to use it, we also need to make Angular aware of this styling package we want to use. To do that, open the file **angular.json** in the root directory of the project, and add the following to the `"styles"` property:
```
"styles": [
  "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css",
  "src/styles.css"
],
```
Note that we import the bootstrap stylesheet first, so that we're able to overwrite it as needed.
