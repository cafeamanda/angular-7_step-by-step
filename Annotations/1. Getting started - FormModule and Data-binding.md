# Getting started
Let's make a simple website that takes in a name as input and prints a message on the page instantly with data-binding.

1. Import `FormsModule` into your *app.module.ts*
```
import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';
```

2. Add it to the @NgModule imports:
```
@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    FormsModule
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
```

3. Change *app.component.html* making sure the input field uses data binding with ngModel, like so:
```
<input type="text" [(ngModel)]="name">
<p>Hi, {{ name }}!</p>
```

4. To add the variable 'name' to the scope, go to *app.component.ts* and change the export class to:
```
export class AppComponent {
  name = '';
}
```

5. On the terminal, `cd` to the project's directory and run `ng serve`. To access your page, in your browser visit the URL `localhost:4200`. Change the input to make sure everything works!
